# Rlt

rlt is a git wrapper with convenient methods included.

## Commands

### cmt
```bash
$ rlt cmt
Subject: Fix a bug where user cannot login
Body:
> There was a problem at ......
>
```

If there's nothing to put as body, you can just hit enter to skip it.

### switch
```bash
$ rlt switch <branch_name>
```

This will switch to `<branch_name>`. If the branch does not exist, then it will create it.

## Configuration

The great power in rlt comes from configuration, using ERB syntax in YAML.

```yaml
command:
  switch:
    branch_name_template: feature-<%= branch_name %>
  cmt:
    subject_template: My prefix <%= subject %>
    body_template: <%= body %> http://...
alias:
  br: branch
  sw: switch
  l: log --oneline
```

### switch
When you type `rlt switch login`, then it will automatically switch to a branch named `feature-login`.
* Variable available for `branch_name_template` is `branch_name`.

### cmt
When you `cmt` with subject 'Hello' and body 'World', then the commit message will be:

```
My prefix Hello

World http://...
```

* Variables available for `subject_template` are `branch_name` and `subject`.
* Variables available for `body_template` are `branch_name` and `body`.

### alias
You can define alias as you want.

### Advanced
You can utilize this configuration as you want. Just for your information, you can do things like this:

```yaml
command:
  switch:
    branch_name_template: JIRA-<%= branch_name %>
  cmt:
    subject_template: >
      <%=
        if branch_name.start_with?('JIRA-')
          "[#{branch_name}] #{subject}"
        else
          subject
        end
      %>
    body_template: >
      <%=
        if branch_name.start_with?('JIRA-')
          "http://myjira.com/#{branch_name}\n\n#{body}"
        else
          body
        end
      %>
alias:
  br: branch
  sw: switch
  l: log --oneline
```

If you do `rlt switch 123`, then you'll be in `JIRA-123` branch.

As long as you're in that branch, when you `cmt` with subject 'Hello' and body 'World', then the commit message will be:

```
[JIRA-123] Hello

http://myjira.com/JIRA-123

World
```

This helps you construct commit message with a convention of yours.

## Installation

    $ brew install rlt

rlt wraps all the native commands of git. So you can make the alias like the following:

    $ echo "alias git='rlt'" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
